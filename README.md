## Overview

### What's the problem?
Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important. 

### How can technology help?
Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well. 

## The idea
We will provide a set of resources that developers can build upon to enhance remote education during times of social distancing. In this starter kit, we will include 3 things:

1. A sample Loopback Node.js app and tutorial that can function as a quiz/test platform, running on IBM Cloud.
2. A sample python app and tutorial that can take instructional videos and extract the text via Watson Speech to Text so that instructors can provide notes to students who might now find video and audio tools as their preferred way to learn.
3. A tutorial on setting up a Skills Network platform to provide a highly configurable, robust virtual classroom environment for instructors that allows for course development, virtual assistant help, live classrooms, and more.
